\subsection{Implementing boundary conditions in two dimensions}
We generalized our code to allow for Dirichlet conditions, i.e. $u_{\mathrm{boundary}} = f(x, y)$ and Neumann conditions $\fracpx u_{\mathrm{x-boundary}} = 0$, $\fracpy u_{\mathrm{y-boundary}} = 0$. Each side can be set to either of these two boundary conditions.


\subsection{Tests}
We implemented a series of tests for checking that all the algorithms work properly. These are described more elaborately in \vref*{appx:testing}.
