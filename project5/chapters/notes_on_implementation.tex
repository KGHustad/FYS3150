\subsection{Parallelization of the 2D explicit scheme}
\subsubsection{Work distribution and granularity}
\cite{inf3380_bok}
With the explicit scheme, we can compute $v_{ij}^l$ for all $i, j \in \indicesetinner$, if all values at the previous time step are known.

Since there are $(N - 1)^2$ independent values to be computed, the finest decomposition we could make, would be a 2D decomposition with $(N - 1)^2$ workers.

If one assumes that the values have already been distributed among the $\frac{N^2}{n^2}$ workers, and that each worker is responsible for computing $n^2$ values. This would lead to each

In order to simplify matters, we use a 1D decomposition (along the y-axis).
